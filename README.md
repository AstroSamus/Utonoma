Utonoma is a social network like no other. It works on the blockchain and allows content creators to earn cryptocurrencies for each like. Only one condition: if a content has too many dislikes it will be removed from the platform. This small change in the rules allows content moderation in a democratic and decentralized way, contributing to the creation of the freer internet we all dream of.

This github repository covers only the “back-end” of the project, the smart contract that works on the blockchain and has all the business rules written. This smart contract allows users to upload content by classifying it into any of the following categories:
<ul>
  <li>🎧 audios</li>
  <li>🎶 music</li>
  <li>🎙️ podcasts</li>
  <li>🎤 audioLivestreams</li>
  <li>📹 videos</li>
  <li>🎬 shortVideos</li>
  <li>🎥 movies</li>  
  <li>📡 videoLivestreams</li>
  <li>💬 comments</li>
  <li>📝 blogs</li>
  <li>📚 books</li>  
  <li>🖼️ images</li>
  <li>🌀 animations</li>
  <li>🎮 videoGames</li>
  <li>📱 apps</li>
</ul>

The smart contract, being public on the blockchain, allows you – yeah, you! – to create your own social network with all the functionalities that the system offers (user names, content libraries, awards, punishments, etc.) by just calling the methods from the deployed contract.
