# Utonoma

All community needs an efficient way of encouraging collaboration. That’s why we created Utonoma, a content sharing platform that rewards you for uploading useful content. You can use the IPFS technology to share whatever you want and get crypto for every like. Only one condition: As the platform is built as a decentralized application (dapp), there is no way for moderating the content, instead, the users will vote, if a content has more dislikes than likes it will be deleted from the platform.

With this, we are hoping to create a free internet without any corporation determining what can be said and what not.
