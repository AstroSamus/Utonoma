# Utonoma

**Utonoma** is a decentralized social network like no other.  
It runs on blockchain and allows content creators to **earn cryptocurrency for each like** they receive.  

The twist?  
- If content gets too many dislikes, it will be removed from the platform.  
- This creates a system of **democratic and decentralized moderation**, shaping a freer and fairer internet.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Create content** → Users upload content or documentary evidence of actions.  
2. **Voting** → Other users vote on-chain (likes/dislikes).  
3. **Rewards** → Authors earn cryptocurrency proportional to positive votes.  
4. **Moderation** → If negative votes prevail, content is removed and the author penalized.
